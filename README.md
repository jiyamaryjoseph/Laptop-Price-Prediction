Project Overview:
The project aims to build a website where users can predict the price of a laptop based on various features such as brand, laptop type, RAM, weight, operating system, GPU, touchscreen availability, IPS display, hard drive capacity, SSD capacity, screen size, screen resolution, and processor.

Project Phases:
Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Dataset collected from Kaggle.
Series of cleaning and preprocessing steps performed:
Missing value detection and handling.
Data transformation and scaling.
Outlier detection and removal.
Feature engineering.
Dimensionality reduction.
Model Building and Evaluation:

Various regression models evaluated.
Random Forest model selected with 88% accuracy.
Model evaluation techniques include:
Accuracy evaluation.
Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
K-fold cross-validation.
Development of Flask Server:

Python Flask used to create an HTTP server.
Flask server serves requests and provides predictions using the saved model.
Website Development:

Website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Features of the website include:
Dropdown list for selecting laptop features.
Integration with Flask server to retrieve predicted price.
