## Project Overview

The project aims to build a website where users can predict the price of a laptop based on features such as brand, RAM, weight, operating system, GPU, etc.

## Project Phases

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:
   - Dataset collected from Kaggle.
   - Data cleaning and preprocessing steps performed.

2. **Model Building and Evaluation**:
   - Various regression models evaluated.
   - Random Forest model selected with 88% accuracy.

3. **Development of Flask Server**:
   - Python Flask used to create an HTTP server.
   - Server serves predictions using the saved model.

4. **Website Development**:
   - Website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   - Integration with Flask server to retrieve predicted price.
